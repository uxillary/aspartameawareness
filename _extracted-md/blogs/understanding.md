### What is Aspartame?

Aspartame is a low-calorie artificial sweetener approximately 200 times sweeter than sugar. It is commonly used as a sugar substitute in various food and beverage products to reduce calorie content without sacrificing sweetness.

### Current Recommended Daily Intake

Different global health organizations have established Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) levels for aspartame:

* **World Health Organization (WHO) / Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA)**: **40 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day (mg/kg bw/day)**.
* **European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)**: **40 mg/kg bw/day**.
* **United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)**: **50 mg/kg bw/day**.

For an average adult weighing **70 kg (154 lbs)**, this means up to **2,800 mg (WHO/EFSA)** or **3,500 mg (FDA)** of aspartame per day. Considering that a typical can of diet soda contains about **180 mg** of aspartame, this equates to approximately **15 to 19 cans** per day to exceed the ADI.

### Historical Perspective on ADI

The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for aspartame has remained largely unchanged since the 1980s. Extensive research and reviews by various global health authorities have consistently upheld these ADI levels, suggesting the safety of aspartame within established limits.

### Recent Evaluations and Safety Reviews

In 2023, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified aspartame as "possibly carcinogenic to humans" (Group 2B), based on limited evidence suggesting a potential link to cancer. Despite this, JECFA reviewed the data and maintained the existing ADI of **40 mg/kg bw/day**, concluding that the evidence was not sufficient to warrant a change.



### Aspartame Content in Common Branded Products

Understanding the aspartame content in various products can help consumers monitor their intake:

| Product | Serving Size | Approximate Aspartame Content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Diet Coke** | 12 fl oz (355 mL) can | ~180 mg |
| **Diet Pepsi** | 12 fl oz (355 mL) can | ~124 mg |
| **Coke Zero Sugar** | 12 fl oz (355 mL) can | ~87 mg |
| **Pepsi Zero Sugar** | 12 fl oz (355 mL) can | ~111 mg |
| **Sprite Zero** | 12 fl oz (355 mL) can | ~75 mg |
| **Fanta Zero** | 12 fl oz (355 mL) can | ~75 mg |
| **Dr Pepper Diet** | 12 fl oz (355 mL) can | ~123 mg |
| **Sugar-Free Chewing Gum** (e.g., Trident, Orbit) | 1 piece (~2g) | ~6-8 mg |
| **Crystal Light Drink Mix** | 8 fl oz (240 mL) serving | ~25 mg |
| **Equal Sweetener** (Aspartame-based) | 1 packet (~1g) | ~37 mg |
| **Sugar-Free Jell-O Gelatin Dessert** | 1/2 cup (92g) serving | ~80 mg |
| **Yoplait Light Yogurt** | 6 oz (170g) container | ~80 mg |
| **Diet Snapple Tea** | 16 fl oz (473 mL) bottle | ~72 mg |
| **Sugar-Free Hot Chocolate Mix** | 1 envelope (~11g) | ~55 mg |
| **SlimFast Diet Shake** | 11 fl oz (325 mL) can | ~50 mg |

### Why Awareness Matters

Most individuals consume aspartame well below the ADI. However, those with phenylketonuria (PKU) must avoid it entirely, as their bodies cannot metabolize phenylalanine, a component of aspartame. Awareness of cumulative intake is also important for individuals consuming multiple aspartame-containing products daily.

### Conclusion

Aspartame has been a part of the global food supply for over four decades, with consistent evaluations supporting its safety within established intake levels. While recent classifications have sparked discussions, leading health authorities have reaffirmed the acceptable daily intake based on comprehensive scientific reviews. Understanding the aspartame content in various foods and beverages empowers consumers to make informed dietary choices that align with their health goals.
