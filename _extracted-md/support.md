### Why Support Us?

At Aspartame Awareness, we believe that everyone deserves to know what's in their food and the potential effects on health. It starts with Aspartame but the food industry needs more transparency as a whole. With your help, we can promote transparency, raise awareness about the risks of artificial sweeteners, and push for better regulations in the food industry.
