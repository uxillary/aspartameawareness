Across Europe, a growing number of citizens, doctors, scientists, and public health organizations are demanding that **aspartame be banned from food and drinks**. At the center of this movement is a petition led by [foodwatch](https://www.foodwatch.org/en/no-to-aspartame-in-our-food-and-drinks)—a respected consumer advocacy group—calling on the European Commission to take urgent action.

### What's the Petition About?

The petition is based on the classification of aspartame as “possibly carcinogenic to humans” by the World Health Organization's cancer research arm, the **IARC**. Combined with concerns from independent researchers and consumers experiencing side effects, the case against aspartame is building rapidly. Yet, it remains in products consumed daily by children, pregnant women, and people managing diabetes.



### The Health Argument

Studies have linked aspartame to headaches, mood disorders, and—at higher doses—potential cancer risks. Although regulators argue current levels are safe, this assumes moderate use. Critics warn that this assumption is outdated and ignores cumulative or long-term exposure, especially in vulnerable populations.

### Public Support is Growing

More than **50,000 signatures** have already been gathered. Foodwatch argues that in a society guided by precautionary principles, substances flagged as potentially dangerous should be pulled from shelves—*not protected by outdated risk assessments*.

> "We don't want to wait until the damage is proven beyond all doubt. That's not precaution, that's negligence." - Foodwatch
